# This is an experiment list for nest js.

- Will create some projects to learn how to implement the nestJS feature in my project.
-  And will collect some sources to help quickly start a nestJS project
---

## Generate a new demo project for experimental. 
```sh
 # skip git init, skip package install. use npm. use ts. to create an demo
 nest new <project name> -g -s -p npm -l TS
```

## Project name
- End with the template, which is not experimental. is a template source for quick dev.
- Other names are normally for experimental.  include all files inside the folder. Do not let them slip out.
- Outside will always keep .gitignore and README.md
- Inside the folder can also be a .git folder.
